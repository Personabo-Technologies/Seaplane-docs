# CLI Quick Start Guide

</div>

This guide will walk you through downloading and installing the Seaplane
command line interface (CLI). You can find more information about
downloading and installing the Seaplane CLI here.

1.  Download the latest Seaplane Command Line Interface being careful to
    select the correct version for your operating system and machine. Do
    not open or unzip/extract the file just yet.
2.  To extract and install the CLI from the `Downloads` directory,
    replace `$ARCH` and `$VERSION` with whichever architecture and
    version you downloaded from the release page (or simply copy over
    the filename) then execute the command that matches your operating
    system:
    -   For macOS use
        `sudo unzip ./seaplane-$VERSION-$ARCH.zip -d /usr/local/bin/`.
    -   For Linux, use
        `sudo tar xzf ./seaplane-$VERSION-$ARCH.tar.gz -C /usr/local/`.
3.  To configure your API key, run `seaplane account login` then follow
    the instructions inside your terminal. You\'ll need to have a
    Seaplane API key handy for this step, so be sure to check Flightdeck
    if you need a quick copy and paste.
4.  You\'re ready to get started with Seaplane ðŸŽ‰!

**Working in Windows?**

Windows does not have an equivalent to `/usr/local/bin` --- you'll need
to either extract and use the Seaplane CLI from your current directory
or make a dedicated directory and add it to `PATH` manually.
