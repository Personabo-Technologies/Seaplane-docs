# Account Creation and Setup

</div>

To get started with Seaplane, you'll need a Seaplane account. To create
a Seaplane account, head over to flightdeck.cplane.cloud. Currently,
Seaplane **only** supports single sign-on with Google, so you'll need a
Google account in order to use Seaplane.

Click Login with Google and select the Google account you'd like to use
with Seaplane. After creating your Seaplane account, you will be asked
to accept the acceptable use, privacy, and cookie policies, which you
can read on our website.

Make sure you follow these steps in order, starting with account
creation and ending with API key generation.

-   Create an account
-   Add billing details
-   Create a tenant
-   Create an API key

## Add Billing Details​

Navigate to flightdeck.cplane.cloud/checkout or click your name in the
top right corner of the screen and select Billing from the drop down.
You can also click Company in the sidebar then select Billing.

**Billing Permissions**

Billing is done on a per company basis, and only users with Company
Owner permissions can manage an account\'s billing options. If you are a
user being added to an existing account that already has billing
details, you can skip this step.

</div>

</div>

Click on set up billing and enter your payment details as prompted.
Seaplane currently only supports credit card payments through our web
interface. If you want to pay using another method, please contact
support.

## Tenant Creation​

Seaplane uses a tenant system to organize usage within a single account.
Tenants can be individual users, a group of users, or even an entire
department/company --- it's completely up to you! You can create up to
10 tenants per company, but you need to create at least one tenant
before you can generate an API key.

Make sure your tenant name is URL safe! Seaplane uses the tenant name as
part of resource URLs. For example:
`https://formation.TENANT.on.cplane.cloud`

## API Key Creation​

To generate an API key, you first need to create a tenant. If you
haven't created a tenant already, head over to
flightdeck.cplane.cloud/tenant and make one now.
